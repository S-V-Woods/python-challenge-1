Module 2 Challenge
This challenge put to use the methods and storage devices we've learned so far. By using dictionaries we can view information for a pair but also change the value when needed. We also used a list to hold dictionaries, showing there arer multiple ways to store information. Using dictionaries "update" and lists "append" showed how they are used for similar goals. 
Another aspect of this project was cycling and retrieving information from dictionaries. Using items, keys, and values to go through for loops.
List comprehension at the end showed a quick way to pull and multiple information without multiple lines of code.
